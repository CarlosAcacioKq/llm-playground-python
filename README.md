ðŸ§  LLM & NLP Learning Playground
This repository contains a collection of basic yet powerful scripts for learning and experimenting with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) using Python. These are designed for beginners who want to understand foundational concepts like tokenization, translation, spell checking, embeddings, and more â€” all without needing an API key.

ðŸ“‚ File Overview
Datasets.py
Loads and previews NLP datasets such as IMDB reviews using Hugging Face's datasets library. Useful for learning how real text datasets are structured and accessed for training or evaluation.

Machine_translation.py
Demonstrates how to perform machine translation (e.g., English to French) using a pre-trained model. Highlights how LLMs can handle multilingual tasks.

N-grams.py
Illustrates how to break down text into n-grams (like bigrams or trigrams), a classic NLP technique used for tasks like language modeling and spell correction.

Read.md
This README file â€” documents the purpose of each file and how they fit together as part of a learning journey in LLMs and NLP.

Sentence_Transformers.py
Uses sentence-transformers to compute vector embeddings for text and compare sentence similarity. Forms the base of semantic search, clustering, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

spacy_example.py
Applies spaCy to extract named entities from a sentence, such as people, places, and money values. Introduces Named Entity Recognition (NER), a key task in NLP pipelines.

Spell_Check.py
Implements or demonstrates a simple spell-checking approach using NLP concepts such as tokenization and edit distance.

Text_Classification.py
Introduces basic text classification logic, likely using keywords, vectorization, or model-based classification. Common use cases include spam detection or sentiment analysis.

Tokenize_text.py
Breaks down raw text into smaller components like words or subwords. Tokenization is one of the most essential preprocessing steps for any NLP task.

transformers_example.py
Generates text using a transformer model like GPT-2 via Hugging Face's transformers library. Gives a hands-on example of how LLMs can produce fluent text.

ðŸ”§ Setup
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers torch datasets sentence-transformers spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
ðŸš€ How to Use
Run any script to see a concept in action:

bash
Copy
Edit
python Tokenize_text.py
python spacy_example.py
Most examples work offline after initial model download, and none require an API key.

ðŸ§  Learning Focus
These scripts help you understand:

Core NLP preprocessing (tokenization, n-grams)

Classic and modern NLP tasks (NER, classification, translation)

Semantic representations (embeddings)

Using transformer models without relying on paid APIs
